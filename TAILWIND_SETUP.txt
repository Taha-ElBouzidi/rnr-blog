✅ Tailwind CSS is now fully configured and active!

Your app now uses Tailwind CSS v4.1.18 instead of inline styles.

Changes made:
1. Removed all inline CSS from layouts/application.html.erb
2. Converted all views to use Tailwind utility classes:
   - posts/index.html.erb - list page with filters
   - posts/_post.html.erb - post card partial  
   - posts/show.html.erb - post detail with comments
   - posts/new.html.erb - create post form
   - posts/edit.html.erb - edit post form
   - posts/_form.html.erb - form partial
   - sessions/new.html.erb - login page

3. Tailwind classes used:
   - Layout: max-w-2xl, mx-auto, px-4, flex, gap-2
   - Cards: bg-white, rounded-lg, shadow, p-4
   - Buttons: bg-blue-600, text-white, rounded-md, hover:bg-blue-700
   - Forms: border, border-gray-300, w-full, text-sm
   - Colors: gray-100 (background), blue-600 (primary), green-600 (success), red-500 (danger)

The CSS is already built and ready to use. Just run 'bin/dev' to start the server!
